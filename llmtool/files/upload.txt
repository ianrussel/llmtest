The Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002. The dynamic "Shaq-and-Kobe" era ended when the Lakers traded away O' Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals.
